# Current plan

**What is open:**
- [docs/audit_2/01_Health.md](../docs/audit_2/01_Health.md): findings H1–H16 and phases R0–R3, each
  step only on the user's order.
- The decisions are in docs/07_Record.md, and finished task logs in [archive.md](archive.md).

**Finished, and in git:**
- audit 1 (V52–V89, `git show 3a5ec16:docs/audit_1/06_Plan.md`);
- the figures (V80–V89);
- the manual's rebuild (V90–V92, `git show 3a5ec16:docs/audit_2/02_Manual.md`).
- `[config]` (V93–V97): it replaces `[master]`; `import` nests, crosses projects and takes `only` a part; `drop`; `vars`; `meta` (version warnings). The doc is 04 §3.
- `[run.cfgs.<cfg>]` (V98–V100): configurations moved out of `[run]`; `[run]` gives every configuration its keys (`[run.defaults]` gone); an import's location rule is per folder.
- Decks, `hep deck` (V102–V104, docs/reporter, 2026-10-10): `figures/layout.py` (sheets and composites: pdflatex, PNG by pdftoppm), `runner/deck.py` (blocks from result folders or a folder's files; composites; deck.md through pandoc to Beamer, pptx, dzslides HTML, an Overleaf zip), `runner/viewer.py`; the manual's 03 §11, 04 §15, 05 §1.8.

## Now

**docs/framework/** (2026-10-08 … 10-10): the plan set for AI agents that set up **Heimdall** on the
**lab PC after a clean reinstall** (D16). Planning only; nothing here changes.
- **Round 2c (2026-10-10), the user's layout (D26–D33):**
  - `~/Github/Heimdall` is the framework **and** `$HEP`, with the recipes at its root;
  - `env/` (hep_env.sh, flags.sh, stack.toml/stack.py, and `env/venv/`), `framework/` (bin, runner,
    tools, schema, templates, work.mk, hepkit.py; `Apps/` ignored), `src/` (today's utils/ minus
    Env);
  - ignored: `stack/` (installs), `forge/` (builds in progress), `stash/` (downloads), `env/venv/`,
    `framework/Apps/`, `.setup/`;
  - work dirs keep `build/`; **Top-Quark** (`~/Github/Top-Quark`, generic starter) is P5's test
    work dir;
  - **High-Energy is left alone** (its lean conversion is parked in 08's appendix).
- The files:
  - [README](../docs/framework/README.md) (D1–D16, D26–D33);
  - [01_Target](../docs/framework/01_Target.md) (the tree, the seam, C1–C80, the move map: 215 fw /
    1363 work at 81253a4, re-tested), [02_Agents](../docs/framework/02_Agents.md);
  - the phases [03](../docs/framework/03_Preflight.md)–[09](../docs/framework/09_Verify.md);
  - `targets/`.
- **Next, the user's:** review; then 01 §8's pre-wipe checklist (push `rework`, keep datasets/
  literature/cross_machine/reports, the reference point, optionally the tarballs and memory).
- Found while writing 2b (not fixed): `hep reproduce` still builds `--set run.<cfg>.seed_type` (pre-V98),
  so it probably fails on a random-seed configuration (C78); `build/flags.mk` was last probed without
  `load_hep` (self-heals).

Otherwise nothing is in progress. Waiting on the user:

- **R0:** verify the mpl pages against mkhtml's, after which the yoda backend goes (H11).
- **R1–R3** of the health check: quick fixes (a compare figure drawn once, H2), then structure
  (`runner/figures.py`, the figure-class rules in the schema), then sheets, tests and docs.
- **`hep migrate --stamp`** (the [config] plan's optional C3 S3): it would write the stack's versions into `[config.meta].versions`. Only if wanted.
- **Later**, on the user's word:
  - F8 `--more`;
  - F9, a Slurm/HTCondor executor;
  - K15, the `HEKIT_*` rename;
  - Paint's PDF line widths (about 2× too thick);
  - the held C++/Rivet items (K3, K4, K7, K8, K10, yd2rt's dead parameter);
  - `extends`/`common.toml` for validation ("not now").

## Standing constraints

- **Commits:**
  - local, never pushed, with the Co-Authored-By line;
  - stage named paths only, never `commit -a`: the worktree holds the user's uncommitted
    `configs/`, `modules/Demo/Rivet/photo_eic.plot`, a legacy README deletion and
    `docs/Untitled-1.md`.
- **Tests:**
  - tests never read or write the user's `configs/` and `results/` (V52: `tests/fixtures/configs/`);
  - one pytest session at a time, and the slow suite not while the user's long runs share the cores;
  - `source ~/HEP/setup.sh` before make or pytest, or `build/flags.mk` is re-probed empty.
- **Approvals:**
  - `~/HEP` changes and downloads need the user's approval; the venv and `hep_env.sh` are the
    user's;
  - a rebuilt App_Pythia, App_yd2rt, InprocJets or Rivet plugin changes the identity of every point
    that ran it, so ask before rebuilding (Paint is plot-only and safe).
- **Docs:** after changing a schema key's `doc`/`notes`, base.toml's comments or the CLI's help, run
  `make docs` (and `make schema`).
- **Way of working:** never implement without an explicit order; plans first, questions when a
  request is ambiguous.
