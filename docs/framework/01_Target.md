# 01 — The target

What exists when the plans are done, and the contract between its parts. This page details
[README](README.md) §3's decisions without reopening them. Rows added here continue the numbering
(§9).

> **As built (2026-10-10).** This page is the design of rounds 1–2c, and the code cites it by section
> (`framework/01 §5.2`). Its seam is built: the seed (old P1) and the seam (old P3) are Heimdall's
> history, `99da1d3`…`c6e7590`, and the manual's V105–V113 record them. The phase files were then
> rewritten for a fresh machine that starts from a clone of Heimdall: 03 Preflight (P0), 04 Stack
> (P1, `@primary`), 05 Framework (P2), 06 Work dirs (P3), 07 Verify (P4). Below, a phase number,
> a file `04`–`09` or a C-row's "Becomes" refers to the old set (`git show c6e7590:docs/framework/<file>`).
>
> Where the build differs from this page:
>
> **The machine root (audit 3, phase 3.1; V122).** Everything this page puts in Heimdall's ignored
> trees moved out of the checkout, to `~/Himinbjorg` (`$HEP_MACHINE`): `stack/`, `venv/` (was
> `env/venv/`), `apps/` (was `framework/Apps/`, the placeholder `{apps}`), `forge/` with
> `downloads/` and `src/` (was `stash/`) and `build/<pkg>/` (was `forge/<pkg>/`), `stacks/<toolkit>/`,
> and `machine.sh` (was `env/machine.sh`). Read this page's paths through that map; Heimdall's
> checkout holds what git has only. The recipes and toolkits (phase 3.2, V123) are one file each in
> `recipes/toolkits/` (`standard.toml` holds every recipe, which was `packages.toml`; `toolkits.toml`
> and `toolkits.d/` are gone; a machine's own toolkits are in the root's `toolkits/`).
>
> Earlier differences:
> - per-machine lines go to `env/machine.sh` (now the machine root's), not `stack/setup_extra.sh` (§5.8, D28);
> - the build's rules shared by both makefiles are `framework/rules.mk`; the C++ standard is the
>   stack's, `stack/.stamps/cxx_std`; every output depends on `flags.mk` (§5.4);
> - `[framework] expects` is checked with `git rev-list` (§4.2), and `hep reproduce` warns when a
>   recorded revision moved (§5.6);
> - the fixture work dir has a `Makefile`, `jets.toml` says `{work}`, `delphes_jets.py` finds hepkit
>   under `$HEP/framework`, and the capture-time photo_eic sources are frozen in
>   `tests/reference/legacy_run/plugin/`; the session builds the fixture's modules once (§5.7);
> - the stack's recipes gained toolkits (`recipes/toolkits.toml`, `toolkits.d/`, isolated stacks in
>   `stacks/<toolkit>/`, V110), and a fresh machine builds `@primary`.

The phase files (`03`–`07`) say *how* to get here. This page says *what* "here" is, and it gives
three things those phases build on:
- the classification of every coupling in the code (§6);
- the move map (§7);
- the list of what the user keeps before the reinstall (§8).

**History:**
- 2026-10-08: written against `rework` at `33b0ed9` (round 2a).
- 2026-10-10: updated against `9cb907a` for the decks, V102–V104 (round 2b).
- 2026-10-10: **round 2c**, the user's layout:
  - Heimdall at `~/Github/Heimdall`, which is itself `$HEP`;
  - `stack/ forge/ stash/`, `env/venv/` and `framework/Apps/` ignored;
  - `env/` for the Python and HEP environment;
  - `framework/` and `src/`;
  - Top-Quark as the test work dir;
  - High-Energy left alone (D26–D33).

Every file:line below was checked by grep at `9cb907a` or later. Phase P1 pins its own revision,
tagged `split/base`, and re-checks the rows against it.

## 1. Two places, and a source

| Place | Is | Made by | In git |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Heimdall**, `~/Github/Heimdall` (`$HEP`) | the framework **and** the machine's home: the stack's recipes and its installs, the environment, the runner, the tool folders, the kits and apps, the manual, the tests, the agents' state | P1 (the moves), P2 (the stack), P3 (the seam) | its own repo, fresh history (D2). `stack/ forge/ stash/ env/venv/ framework/Apps/ .setup/` are ignored |
| **a work dir**, e.g. `~/Github/Top-Quark` (`$HEP_WORK`, or found from the working directory) | one workspace: configs, modules, datasets, and what runs make of them | `hep setup <dir>` (D14) | its own repo, optional |
| *High-Energy*, `~/Github/High-Energy` | the source P1 seeds Heimdall from, and the origin of the tests' fixture. **Left alone** (D31) | the user's clone | as it is |

There is one Heimdall per machine, and any number of work dirs, which share nothing but Heimdall
(D4). The first work dir is **Top-Quark**, made fresh by `hep setup` as a test (D32).

| the tests | `forge/scratch/` only |
| the agents | `.setup/` |
| a work dir's build | its own `build/`; never anything in Heimdall (D30) |

---

## 3. Why this shape

- **The root is how Heimdall gets onto a machine:**
  ```bash
  git clone <Heimdall> ~/Github/Heimdall && cd ~/Github/Heimdall && python3 build_stack.py
  ```
  This builds the stack into the clone itself, and `source setup.sh` loads it. The recipes sit at
  the root because they are the first thing run.
- **`env/`** is the HEP environment (the user, 2026-10-10):
  - what the shell and make need before Python (`hep_env.sh`, `flags.sh`, and the stack registry
    `stack.toml`/`stack.py` that both read);
  - the Python environment itself, `env/venv/` (ignored).

  `setup.sh` sources `env/hep_env.sh`, which activates `env/venv`.
- **`framework/`** is what runs:
  - the commands (`bin/`);
  - the Python (`runner/`, `hepkit.py`);
  - the folders the runner loads by path (`tools/`, `schema/`);
  - the compiled apps, once built (`Apps/`).

  `tools/` keeps the folder contract (06 §16) unchanged. `runner/tools.py:36`'s `ENV` becomes
  `hep_root() / "framework" / "tools"`, and the yoda and rivet folders never sit on `sys.path` next
  to the real `yoda` and `rivet` packages.
- **`src/`** is what is compiled: today's `utils/` without `Env/` and `hepkit.py` (D29).
  - The Makefile's conventions carry over: `src/App_<X>.cc` and `src/Apps/<X>/main.cc`.
  - A work dir's modules include the kits with `-I $HEP/src`.
- **Ignored, and where each kind of file goes** (D27):
  - `stash/` holds what was downloaded and unpacked;
  - `forge/` holds what is being built: trees, intermediates, test binaries, scratch;
  - `stack/` holds what is installed, and `env/venv/` the Python packages;
  - `framework/Apps/` holds the framework's own programs, ready to run.

  `forge/` and `stash/` may be emptied at any time; `stack/`, `env/venv/` and `framework/Apps/` are
  what runs.
- **A repo that holds its own stack** (D33): `git clean -x` in Heimdall would delete `stack/`
  (hours of building). It is never run there, and `CLAUDE.md` says so. Editors exclude `stack/
  forge/ stash/` from watching and search (`.vscode/settings.json`, `files.watcherExclude`).

## 4. A work dir

### 4.1 What `hep setup <dir>` lays down

```
<dir>/
  hep.toml           the marker
  Makefile           include $(HEP)/framework/work.mk
  .gitignore         build/ output/ results/ datasets/* reports/* __pycache__/ *.exe
  README.md          what each folder is for; that datasets/ and reports/ are not in git
  CLAUDE.md          the work dir's agent rules: configs/ and modules/ are the user's; read the manual
                     at $HEP/docs; never write into results/ from a test; stage by path
  .vscode/settings.json   files.watcherExclude for build/ output/ results/ (D33)
  configs/  modules/  datasets/  results/  output/  reports/  build/
```

With `--project <P>`, it also writes:
- `configs/<P>/<p>.toml`, a commented starter run TOML: one App_Pythia → Rivet (`MC_JETS`) → yd2rt
  chain, 2 PDFs, 500 events, with a `[plot]`, which `hep check <P>/<p>` accepts (06 S2);
- `configs/<P>/<p>.cmnd`, its base card;
- an empty `modules/<P>/`.

Git does not keep empty folders. On a fresh clone of a work dir, `hep setup <dir>` (idempotent)
makes the missing ones again, so no `.gitkeep` files are needed.

### 4.2 `hep.toml`

```toml
# hep.toml — this folder is a Heimdall work dir (made by `hep setup`, 2026-…).
[work]
name = "Top-Quark"

[framework]
expects = "<Heimdall's revision when this file was made>"
```

**What `hep.toml` means:**
- **`[work]`** marks the work dir. A `hep.toml` without it is not a marker.
- **`name`** is the folder's name unless `--name` gives one. It is used in provenance and in `hep
  where`.
- **`[framework] expects`** is checked the way `[config.meta]` is (V97): warned about, never
  enforced. The runner warns once per command when `expects` is not an ancestor of Heimdall's
  `HEAD`, meaning the work dir was made with a newer Heimdall than the one running. A dirty or
  missing revision is not warned about.
- Unknown keys are refused, as in every TOML the runner reads.

### 4.3 Top-Quark, the test work dir (D32)

```bash
hep setup ~/Github/Top-Quark --project Starter --git
```

This makes `~/Github/Top-Quark` with §4.1's files and folders, plus
`configs/Starter/starter.{toml,cmnd}` (the generic starter) and an empty `modules/Starter/`, and
commits once. P5 builds it, checks it and runs it (08 S1). It is a test: the user decides later
what Top-Quark becomes.

### 4.4 Parked: High-Energy as a work dir (D31)

Not done now. High-Energy is the source of P0–P1 and of the fixture only, and stays as it is. If
the user later asks for it, the steps are 08's appendix:
- on a branch `work`, remove the paths §7 sends to Heimdall;
- `hep setup --adopt`;
- `{repo}` → `{work}` by `hep migrate`;
- C65–C67 and C77, shown first.

---

## 5. The seam

### 5.1 Variables

| Variable | Set by | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `HEP` | `setup.sh` (its own folder) | Heimdall: the framework and the machine's home. Replaces `HEKIT_ROOT`; `HEP_FW` is not used (D28) |
| `HEP_INSTALL` | `setup.sh` | `$HEP/stack` |
| `HEP_WORK` | the user, the tests | the work dir, instead of the search (§5.2) |
| `HEP_CONFIGS`, `HEP_OUTPUT`, `HEP_RESULTS`, `HEP_REPORTS` | the user, the tests | replace the work dir's `configs/`, `output/`, `results/`, `reports/` (V52's roles and V103's, renamed) |
| `HEP_SETUP`, `HEP_ENV_LOADED` | `hep_env.sh` | as today |
| `HEP_STATUS_FD` | the runner, per tool | as today |
| `LHAPDF_DATA_PATH`, `GEANT4_DATA_DIR`, `ONNXRUNTIME_DIR` | `hep_env.sh` | as today, under `$HEP/stack` |
| `RIVET_ANALYSIS_PATH` | the rivet and merge folders, per run | `{work}/build/Rivet` |

**Retired:** `HEKIT_ROOT`, `HEKIT_CONFIGS`, `HEKIT_OUTPUT`, `HEKIT_RESULTS` and `HEKIT_REPORTS`
(K15). If one of them is set, every command refuses and names its replacement. A stale shell or
script fails loudly, not silently (01 §4.5 of the manual).

### 5.2 The two roots

`runner/paths.py` replaces `repo_root()` with two functions.

**`hep_root()`** is the Heimdall the code is running from: `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`
(`framework/runner/paths.py`).
- It must hold `framework/runner/`, `framework/tools/` and `framework/schema/run.toml`.
- If `$HEP` is set and resolves elsewhere, the command refuses: two Heimdalls in one shell. The
  convenient inference "use the variable" is refused (01 §4.5).

**`work_root()`** is the work dir:
1. If `$HEP_WORK` is set, it is that directory. It must hold a `hep.toml` with `[work]`, or the
   command is refused.
2. Otherwise, walk up from the working directory to `/`. The first directory whose `hep.toml` has
   a `[work]` table wins.
3. A marker under `hep_root()/tests/` is skipped: the fixture work dir is found only through
   `$HEP_WORK`, which the tests set to its scratch copy (§5.7).
4. If nothing is found: `HepError("not inside a work dir", hint="cd into one, or make one: hep
   setup <dir>")`.

This is the walk-up search the user chose (D3). V13's rule ("never by the working directory") was
about relative paths, and still holds: a path in a run TOML never resolves against the working
directory (§5.3).

**What hangs from each root:**

| Function | Is |
|---|---|
| `configs_root()` | `$HEP_CONFIGS` or `work_root()/configs` |
| `output_root()` | `$HEP_OUTPUT` or `work_root()/output` |
| `results_root()` | `$HEP_RESULTS` or `work_root()/results` |
| `reports_root()` | `$HEP_REPORTS` or `work_root()/reports`: decks (V103) |
| `work_build()` | `work_root()/build`: module programs, `Rivet/`, `deps/`, `flags.mk` |
| `datasets_root()` | `work_root()/datasets` |
| `apps_dir()` | `hep_root()/framework/Apps`: the compiled apps and Herwig's repository |
| `forge_dir()` | `hep_root()/forge`: `make/`, `tests/`, `scratch/` |

A root whose variable is set never searches for the work dir. Tests that set all four variables, as
`test_deck*.py` do, therefore run without one.

**Which commands need which root:**

| Commands | Need |
|---|---|
| `run`, `plot`, `overlay`, `deck`, `check`, `ls`, `status <config>`, `clean`, `reproduce`, `migrate`, `build`, `make` | a work dir |
| `explain`, `status --stack`, `build --framework`, `make --framework` | Heimdall only |
| `setup`, `where`, `watch` without a config | nothing; they run anywhere |

`hep watch` finds runs by their sockets machine-wide (06 §10). With a config, it resolves that
config in the current work dir.

### 5.3 Paths in a run TOML, and placeholders

**Convention roots** (04 §2; `paths.ROOTS`). Each has exactly one root, as before:

| Key | Root |
|---|---|
| `config`, `master`, `import`, `baseconfig`, `filters`, `root_style` | `configs_root()[/<P>]` |
| `executable` | `work_build()/<P>` |
| `data` | `datasets_root()` |

**The path rules:**
- A leading `./` means `work_root()`: V13 restated (D7).
- `/abs` is taken as written.
- `../` is refused.

**Placeholders.** `{repo}` is retired, and two placeholders replace it:

| Placeholder | Is | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `{hep}` | `hep_root()` | `pythia/tool.toml` (`{hep}/framework/Apps/App_Pythia.exe`, `App_PythiaCheck.exe`), `yd2rt`, `plotmerge` (`App_yd2rt.exe`), `herwig` (`{hep}/framework/Apps/Herwig/HerwigDefaults.rpo`) |
| `{work}` | `work_root()` | `rivet` and `merge` (`{work}/build/Rivet`), a run TOML's own arguments and `[prelim.commands]` (`{work}/modules/…`) |

- **A run TOML that still says `{repo}`** is refused with a hint: "`{repo}` is retired: `{work}`
  for your files, `{hep}` for Heimdall's; `hep migrate` rewrites it". In a run TOML, `{repo}` only
  ever meant the user's files, so `hep migrate` rewrites it to `{work}` (a new rule in
  `runner/migrate.py`).
- **A tool folder that says `{repo}`** is a load error (folder checks, 06 §16.1).

### 5.4 The build

**`$HEP/Makefile`** builds the framework's programs:

| Source | Output |
|---|---|
| `src/App_<X>.cc` | `framework/Apps/App_<X>.exe` |
| `src/Apps/<X>/main.cc` | `framework/Apps/<X>.exe` (Paint) |
| `tests/cxx/<X>.cc` | `forge/tests/<X>.exe` |
| (Herwig, when on `PATH`) | `framework/Apps/Herwig/HerwigDefaults.rpo`, as today (L15) |

- The targets are `all`, `tests`, `test`, `test-slow`, `configure`, `list`, `schema`, `docs` and
  `clean`.
- `clean` empties `framework/Apps/` and `forge/make/`, `forge/tests/`. It never touches `stack/`,
  `stash/` or the stack's trees in `forge/<pkg>/`.
- The includes are `-I src`. The flags are `forge/make/flags.mk`, written by `env/flags.sh`,
  and the dependency files are in `forge/make/deps/`.

**`$HEP/framework/work.mk`** is included by a work dir's one-line `Makefile`, and builds into the
work dir's `build/` (D30). It keeps today's rules (06 §15.1) for:
- `modules/<P>/<X>.cc` → `build/<P>/<X>.exe`;
- `modules/<P>/Rivet/<x>.cc` and `modules/<P>/Rivet_<x>.cc` → `build/Rivet/Rivet_<x>.so`, with
  their `.info`, `.plot` and `.yoda`;
- any `<dir>/<X>.cc` named on the command line.

It differs from today's rules in four ways:
- the includes are `-I $(HEP)/src -I modules/<P>`, and `rivet-build` gets the same;
- the flags are `<work>/build/flags.mk`, written by `$(HEP)/env/flags.sh` with the same
  key logic (L22). The probe is shared, the caches are per tree (D21);
- `all` is the modules and plugins only;
- there are no `tests`, `schema` or `docs` targets.

**Commands:**

| Command | Is |
|---|---|
| `hep build` | `make -C <work> all`. It warns when a framework app the work's tools need is missing: "run `hep build --framework`" |
| `hep build --framework` | `make -C $HEP all` |
| `hep make …` | `make -C <work> …` |
| `hep make --framework …` | `make -C $HEP …` |
| core count | `os.cpu_count()` through `hep`, not `nproc` (I15) |

Rebuilding a framework app changes the identity of every point, in every work dir, that ran it
(06 §27): the apps are shared. `hep build --framework` says so when it rebuilds an app.

### 5.5 Python

- **`framework/bin/run`** puts `hep_root()/framework` on `sys.path` and imports `runner.cli`.
  `runner/cli.py:808` (`hep reproduce`) runs `framework/bin/run`.
- **The venv** is `env/venv`. Its `site-packages/heimdall.pth` holds one line, `$HEP/framework`
  (D29).
  - It is written by the stack's `python` step, when the venv is made (P2). `hep where` warns when
    it is missing or names another Heimdall.
  - Any Python in the venv can then `from runner import results` (02 §11 of the manual) and `import
    hepkit`, with no `sys.path` lines.
- **Plugins** (`render.py`, `backend.py`, `provider.py`, the figures) are still loaded by path,
  from `framework/tools/<folder>/` (`runner/plugins.py`).

### 5.6 Provenance and identity

`record.provenance()` (`record.py:266`) writes:

```json
"git":  {"heimdall": {"revision": "…", "dirty": false}, "work": {"revision": "…", "dirty": true}},
"hep":  "/home/…/Github/Heimdall",
"work": {"name": "Top-Quark", "root": "/home/…/Github/Top-Quark"}
```

- A work dir that is not a git repo gives `{}` for `work`.
- `hep reproduce` reads both revisions and warns when either differs from now.
- **Identity is unchanged** (D8): `exe_sha256` and `files_sha256` hash contents, so the same
  App_Pythia gives the same identity from any work dir on one machine.

### 5.7 Tests

**The fixture work dir** is `tests/fixtures/work/`. It holds:
- `hep.toml`;
- `README.md` (today's `tests/fixtures/README.md`, re-rooted);
- `configs/`: today's `tests/fixtures/configs/`, moved as is;
- `modules/`: frozen copies of High-Energy's `modules/` at `split/base` (18 files at 9cb907a),
  because the tests build Decay.exe, InprocJets.exe and the photo_eic, DecayRiv and
  particle_spectra plugins;
- `datasets/jets_data.yoda`: 20 kB, from §8's kept files.

These copies are frozen like `configs/`: a change goes only together with the test that needs it.

**A session (`tests/conftest.py`):**
1. Sync `tests/fixtures/work/` into `forge/scratch/work/`. Only changed files are copied, and the
   copy's `build/` is never touched, so make rebuilds only what changed.
2. Set `HEP_WORK` to that copy, and `HEP_OUTPUT`, `HEP_RESULTS` and `HEP_REPORTS` to
   `forge/scratch/{output,results,reports}`.
3. Use `forge/scratch/pytest` as the basetemp.
4. The integration tests that need module programs or plugins run `make -C forge/scratch/work all`
   once per session (a session fixture).

**The guard** keeps V52's first half: `tests/fixtures/` and `tests/reference/` must come out byte
for byte. Its second half (`THEIRS`, the user's `results/ configs/ modules/`) goes. There are no
user folders in Heimdall, and no test may name a real work dir.

The test files that change are listed in §6.4.

### 5.8 The environment

**`setup.sh`** is tracked at Heimdall's root. It replaces the stub `build_stack.py` wrote
(`build_stack.py:51-57`, `:443`), and finds its own folder, so a clone anywhere works:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup.sh — Heimdall's environment: source it once per session (alias load_hep). Tracked; finds its own folder.
export HEP=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)
export HEP_INSTALL=$HEP/stack
[ -f "$HEP/stack/setup_extra.sh" ] && source "$HEP/stack/setup_extra.sh"     # this machine's lines (macOS: DYLD, GNU tools)
source "$HEP/env/hep_env.sh"
```

`settings.toml`'s `setup_extra` lines go to `stack/setup_extra.sh`, which `build_stack.py` writes:
they are per machine, so they are not in git.

**`env/hep_env.sh`** changes in five places:

| Lines | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `:10-17` | `HEP` defaults to its own folder's parent; `HEP_INSTALL` to `$HEP/stack`; `HEKIT_ROOT` gone (if set: "retired: HEP" and unset) |
| `:129-131`, `:145-147` (`hep_src`, `hep_build`, `hep_install`) | `hep_stash`, `hep_forge`, `hep_stack` (cd to `$HEP/stash`, `forge`, `stack`) |
| `:133-136` (`hep_cd PROJECT [dir]`) | cds into `$(hep where --work)/<dir>/<P>`, and refuses outside a work dir |
| `:160`, `:162` | the venv at `$HEP/env/venv` |
| `:177` | `$HEP/framework/bin` on `PATH` instead of `utils/Env` |

The rest is unchanged: `quit`, `hep_refresh` and `hep_status`.

**`hep where`** prints two lines, `hep=<Heimdall root> <revision>` and `work=<root or ->`. With
`--hep` or `--work`, it prints one path, for scripts and agents. Its exit code is 2 when the root
asked for does not exist.

---

## 6. Every coupling, classified

This extends README §6. Each row names one call site at `9cb907a` and what it becomes. P3's tasks
cite these rows by number (C1…). The paths in "Becomes" are under `$HEP` unless they say
otherwise.

**Kind:**
- *hep*: a Heimdall file, found from `hep_root()`;
- *work*: under `work_root()`;
- *both*: the site needs both roots;
- *ok*: already derives from a root that §5.2 re-points, so it is unchanged.

### 6.2 Plugins, data and scripts (`utils/Env/` → `framework/`)

| # | Site | Today | Kind | Becomes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C34 | `pythia/tool.toml:4,44`; `yd2rt/tool.toml:5`; `plotmerge/tool.toml:12` | `{repo}/build/App_*.exe` | hep | `{hep}/framework/Apps/App_*.exe` |
| C35 | `herwig/tool.toml:33,48` | `{repo}/build/Herwig/HerwigDefaults.rpo` | hep | `{hep}/framework/Apps/Herwig/HerwigDefaults.rpo` |

| C37 | `schema/run.toml:370` (`[prelim.commands]` notes) | "`{repo}`, `{out}`, …" | — | "`{work}`, `{hep}`, `{out}`, …"; then `make docs` |
| C38 | `yoda/backend.py:313-314`; `mpl/backend.py:102-103` | `build_root()/Rivet` | work | `work_build()/Rivet` (they may import `paths`: `PLUGINS_MAY_IMPORT`) |
| C39 | `mpl/backend.py:36`; `yoda/backend.py:43`; `stack.py:21` | their own location | ok | — (siblings move together) |
| C40 | `hep:12-13`, `:48`, `:52-62` | `root` from `HEKIT_ROOT` or `../..`; `nproc`; `make -C $root` | both | Heimdall from its own location (`framework/bin/` → `../..`); the work root from `run where --work`; `--framework`; a portable core count |
| C41 | `flags.sh` | `here`, `stack.py` beside it; `OUT` default `build/flags.mk` | ok | — (`env/`; make passes `OUT`: `forge/make/flags.mk` or the work's `build/flags.mk`) |
| C42 | `hep_env.sh:10-17,133-136,177` | `HEKIT_ROOT`, `hep_cd`, `PATH` | hep | §5.8 |
| C80 | `hep_env.sh:11,129-131,145-147,160,162` | `HEP_INSTALL=$HEP/install`; `hep_src`/`hep_build`/`hep_install`; the venv at `$HEP/.venv` | hep | `$HEP/stack`; `hep_stash`/`hep_forge`/`hep_stack`; `$HEP/env/venv` (§5.8) |
| C43 | `hepkit.py:6` (docstring) | the `sys.path` line from `modules/<P>/` | hep | "import hepkit" (§5.5) |
| C44 | `Makefile` | one file | both | `Makefile` (`src/` → `framework/Apps/`, intermediates in `forge/make/`) and `framework/work.mk` (§5.4); `Makefile:120`'s `sed -i` made portable (I15) |
| C76 | `src/Apps/Paint/Style.hh:59,110-115` (`basePath()`) | `utils/Apps/Paint/base.toml` beside `build/`, from `/proc/self/exe`, or under `$HEKIT_ROOT` | hep | `src/Apps/Paint/base.toml` under `$HEP` first, then from `/proc/self/exe` (`framework/Apps/Paint.exe` → three levels up) on Linux only (I15). Paint is plot-only: no identity changes |

### 6.3 Stack recipes (`docs/stack/` → the root, `platforms/`, `patches/`)

| # | Site | Today | Becomes |
|---|---|---|---|
| C45 | `build_stack.py:51-57` (`SETUP`), `:387-390` (`setup_text`), `:443-449` | writes `$prefix/setup.sh` (the stub: `HEKIT_ROOT`, `utils/Env/hep_env.sh`) unless one is there | gone: `setup.sh` is tracked (§5.8). `build_stack.py` writes `stack/setup_extra.sh` from `setup_extra` instead |
| C46 | `build_stack.py:43,177`; `settings.toml` `prefix`, `hekit_root` | `REPO = HERE.parent.parent`; `prefix = "~/HEP"`; `{hekit_root}` | `REPO = HERE` (the recipe sits at Heimdall's root); the prefix is `REPO` itself, and `prefix` in `settings.toml` goes; `hekit_root` goes |
| C79 | `build_stack.py:171,184,212,224,349,357,406,433` (the prefix's layout) | `src/`, `build/<pkg>`, `install/`, `.venv/`, `logs/`, `.stamps/` under the prefix | `stash/`, `forge/<pkg>/`, `stack/`, `env/venv/`, `forge/logs/`, `stack/.stamps/` |
| C47 | `build_stack.py:443` | keeps an existing `setup.sh` | gone with C45 |
| C48 | `packages.toml` `[fastjet] patch` | `utils/Env/patches/…` | `patches/fastjet-3.5.0-siscone-thread-local-ranlux.patch` |
| C49 | `Dockerfile` (`COPY docs/stack/`, `utils/Env/patches/`, `HEKIT_ROOT=/work`); `Dockerfile.dockerignore` | the repo's layout | `platforms/container/`; the build context is Heimdall, and the image holds `/opt/heimdall` with its stack inside (targets/container.md) |
| C50 | `mac/launch.sh`, `mac/README.md`; `docs/stack/README.md`, `build_by_hand.txt` | `utils/Env/hep_env.sh`, `~/HEP`'s `src/ build/ install/` | `platforms/mac/`: `$HEP/setup.sh`, `HEP` defaulting to `~/Github/Heimdall`; the docs describe `stash/ forge/ stack/` |
| C51 | `packages.toml [python]` | the venv (`{venv}` = `$prefix/.venv`) and `python_packages` | the venv at `env/venv`; one more `pre` command writes `heimdall.pth` with `$HEP/framework` (§5.5); `python_packages` unchanged |

### 6.4 Tests

| # | Site | Becomes |
|---|---|---|
| C52 | `conftest.py:23-34` | `HEP = parents[1]`; `sys.path` gets `HEP/framework`; the scratch work in `forge/scratch/` (§5.7); `HEP_*` (with `HEP_REPORTS`); the guard without `THEIRS` |
| C53 | `pytest.ini` | unchanged |
| C54 | `test_paths.py` (whole) | rewritten for §5.2–5.3: `hep_root`, the walk-up search, `HEP_WORK`, the `tests/` skip, the `HEKIT_*` refusal, `{repo}` refused |
| C55 | `test_hepkit.py:14-20` | `HEP/framework/hepkit.py`; `Kit.hh` at `HEP/src` |
| C56 | `test_stack.py:14-35` | `HEP/env`; `forge/make/flags.mk` |
| C57 | `test_plan.py:242`; `test_yd2rt.py:11`; `test_post.py:197`; `test_paint.py:21-22,262,272`; `test_plot_stage.py:23`; `test_gates_p1.py:21`; `test_process_generators_p4.py:52` | the apps under `apps_dir()`; `base.toml` at `src/Apps/Paint/` |
| C58 | `test_modules_p4.py:19`; `test_plot.py:91`; `test_plot_stage.py:88` | module programs and plugins under the scratch work's `build/` |
| C59 | `test_gates_run_sweep.py:124` (`cwd=REPO`) | `cwd` = the scratch work |
| C60 | `test_layers.py:268` (message) | `env/stack.toml` |
| C74 | `test_layout.py:15-22` | `HEP/framework/tools/figures/layout.py` |
| C75 | `test_deck.py:32-33,170`; `test_deck_build.py:52-53,129` | `HEP_RESULTS`, `HEP_OUTPUT`, `HEP_REPORTS` |
| C61 | `test_docs.py` | `DOCS = HEP/docs`; `CODE` scans `framework/ src/ tests/` and the `Makefile`, not `modules/` (none in the repo; the fixture's modules are under `tests/`); the link test reads `CLAUDE.md` instead of `bots/BOT.md` |
| C62 | `test_stack_build.py` | the recipes at the root; the prefix layout of C79; no setup text (C45) |
| C63 | `test_imports.py` | `framework/runner/`; the "core never names a tool" check reads `framework/tools/` |
| C64 | `tests/support.py`, `tests/runner/helpers.py` | the `hep` path (`HEP/framework/bin/hep`); the environment helpers set `HEP_*` |

### 6.5 Work → framework (High-Energy's own files): parked (D31)

These are for High-Energy's lean conversion (§4.4), which is not done now. Kept, so the parked step
is complete when the user asks for it.

| # | Site | Would become |
|---|---|---|
| C65 | `configs/Demo/jets.toml:170` | `{work}/modules/Demo/delphes_jets.py` (by `hep migrate`) |
| C66 | `modules/Demo/delphes_jets.py:16` | the `sys.path` line removed |
| C67 | `Inproc/Analysis.hh:68`; the two in-process run TOMLs' line 23 (comments) | `$HEP/patches/…` |
| C77 | comments that cite framework paths: `Inproc/Stamp.hh:3`, `Inproc/Engines.hh:13` (`utils/PythiaRun.hh`), `Inproc/Analysis.hh:13` (`utils/Env/patches/`), `delphes_jets.py:9` (`utils/hepkit.py`), `modules/Decay/README.md:8` (`utils/Module.hh`) | `src/PythiaRun.hh`, `$HEP/patches/`, `framework/hepkit.py`, `src/Module.hh`; shown with C65–C67 |
| C68 | comments citing old manual sections in four of the user's run TOMLs | left to the user, as now |

The reference point (07 S1) is run in a scratch work dir filled from Heimdall's fixture, so High-Energy
is not needed for it.

### 6.6 The manual (`docs/`, P4)

| # | Where | Becomes |
|---|---|---|
| C69 | 01 (layout), 02 §1 and §12, 05 §2, 06 §1, §2, §14, §15, §16, §25; `docs/reporter/`, `docs/stack/` | rewritten for Heimdall and work dirs, by 06's renames |
| C70 | 07 (the record) | new V-rows for this split (V105 onward: V102–V104 are the decks); D-rows here are cited from them |
| C71 | `docs/README.md` | the reading paths, from Heimdall's `README.md`; it lists `docs/stack/`, `docs/reporter/` and `docs/framework/` |

---

## 7. The move map

Every path `git ls-files` lists at `split/base` goes to exactly one place. The block below is data:
P1's script reads it from this page, applies it, and fails on any path matched by no rule.

**Reading a rule:**
- **`side`:** `"fw"` copies the path into Heimdall at `to`; `"work"` leaves it in High-Energy
  only.
- **First match wins.**
- **`to`:** a `to` ending in `/` receives the path minus the rule's literal prefix (everything
  before the first wildcard, up to its last `/`). Any other `to` is a file name.

```toml

**Counts at `81253a4`:** 1578 tracked paths (P1 recounts at `split/base`). The rules were checked
against that list by P1's own script: every path matches one rule, and no two paths land on one
Heimdall path.

| Group | Paths | Goes to |
|---|---|---|
| `utils/Env/` | 69 (`runner/` 25, the 16 plugin folders 32, `schema/` 3 and two TOMLs, `hep`, `run`, `hep_env.sh`, `flags.sh`, `stack.toml`, `stack.py`, the patch) | `framework/` 64, `env/` 4, `patches/` 1 |

**Made new in Heimdall** (P1, P2 and P3), not moved:
- `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `setup.sh`, `pth.py`;
- `framework/work.mk`, `framework/templates/work/*`;
- `platforms/container/heimdall.def`;
- `tests/fixtures/work/{hep.toml, modules/**, datasets/jets_data.yoda}`.

**High-Energy is not changed** (D31). The "work" side of the map only says what Heimdall leaves
behind.

## 8. Before the reinstall (the user's checklist)

The fresh system is this lab PC, wiped (D16). Git holds the code. These are what it does not hold,
to copy to a disk that survives the wipe:

| What | Why | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Heimdall**, every branch | what the new machine clones (02 §1) | push it once published, or `git -C ~/Github/Heimdall bundle create heimdall.bundle --all` |
| High-Energy, every branch and tag | the user's studies and the history before `split/base` | `git push origin rework` (and the tags), or `git bundle create HE.bundle --all` |
| `datasets/` (the one reference dataset, 20 kB) | not in git; the fixture's `jets_data.yoda` is a copy of it | copy |
| `literature/`, `cross_machine/`, `reports/` | the user's, not in git | copy |
| `~/HEP/src/*.tar*`, `*.tgz` and `~/HEP/LHAPDF-6.5.6.tar.gz` (optional, 555 MB) | saves the downloads: `build_stack.py` uses an archive already in `stash/`; 04 S2 renames them to its names | copy |
| **the reference point** (90 kB): in High-Energy, the in-process validation run's point `NNPDF23lo` (configuration `default`): its output folder (`cards/`, `config/`, `provenance.json`) and its results folder | P4 runs it again on its seed and compares (07 S1) | copy the output folder's contents to `kept/reference/output/`, the results folder's to `kept/reference/results/` |
| `results/` (optional) | only to look at again; the comparisons in `07` use numbers recorded in these files | copy if wanted |
| `~/.claude/projects/…High-Energy/memory/` (optional) | the agents' notes about this repo | copy |

**Before the copy:**
- Round 2b recorded the lab PC's baselines into these files: the stack's versions, the PDF sets,
  one reference point's numbers.
- These files are committed in Heimdall, which travels as a push or a bundle, because the baselines
  must survive the wipe.

On the new install, P0 brings the copies back into `~/Github/Heimdall/.setup/kept/`. The user's own
folders stay there until the user says where they go (D31: High-Energy is not touched).

## 9. Decisions added here

These continue README §2's table. Round 2c's D26–D33 are in README §2, and the rows below carry
their amendments.

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D17 | Heimdall's layout is §2's (as amended by D26): the recipes at the root, `env/ framework/ src/ docs/ bots/ tests/ patches/ platforms/`; ignored `stack/ forge/ stash/ env/venv/ framework/Apps/ .setup/`. `framework/tools/` holds every plugin folder, so the folder contract is unchanged. |
| D18 | `hep_root()` is where the running code is. A `$HEP` that disagrees with it is refused. `work_root()` is `$HEP_WORK`, or the first `hep.toml` with `[work]` walking up from the working directory. Markers under `hep_root()/tests/` are skipped. |
| D19 | `{repo}` is retired: `{hep}` and `{work}` (D28). A run TOML's `{repo}` is refused, and `hep migrate` rewrites it to `{work}`. Set `HEKIT_*` variables are refused, naming their replacements. |
| D20 | Commands are scoped (§5.2): work, Heimdall-only, or anywhere. `hep where` is new. `hep build` and `hep make` act on the work dir, and `--framework` acts on Heimdall. |
| D21 | Every build tree has its own `flags.mk` from the one probe: Heimdall's in `forge/make/`, a work dir's in its `build/`. |
| D22 | Python reaches Heimdall through the venv's `heimdall.pth`, one line, `$HEP/framework` (D29). No module or notebook writes `sys.path` lines. |
| D23 | The tests run in a persistent scratch copy of the fixture work dir, `forge/scratch/work`. The fixture carries frozen copies of the modules the tests build. |
| D24 | The move map is data (§7). P1 applies it, and fails on a path no rule matches. |
| D25 | `hep.toml` is `[work] name` and `[framework] expects`, nothing else. `expects` is warned about when it is not an ancestor of Heimdall's `HEAD`, never enforced. |

---

## 10. Risks the phases plan around

| Risk | Where it bites | Plan |
|---|---|---|
| The reinstall is Ubuntu 26.04: some `apt_packages` names may be gone or renamed (`libpcre3-dev` is a likely one: Debian has been removing PCRE 1), and Python and GCC are newer | P2 | P2 S1 checks every package with `apt-cache policy`. The ubuntu annex lists allowed renames as *allowed adjustments* (02 §7). A compiler or Python incompatibility in ROOT, Herwig or Whizard is a gate, not a quiet fix |
| A move breaks a relative assumption the grep did not see | P3 | the fast suite after every task group; C1–C80 are each a task |
| The fixture's frozen modules drift from High-Energy's | P4, later | they are test data (V52's rule): changed only with a test |
| Identities: everything reruns on the new install | P5, P6 | expected; the comparisons in `09` are by numbers within tolerances, not by identity |
| **`git clean -x` in Heimdall deletes `stack/`**, which is hours of building | any time | never run it there (D33; `CLAUDE.md`, README). `forge/` and `stash/` may be emptied by hand; `make clean` never touches the stack |
| An editor or indexer watching 20 GB of `stack/ forge/ stash/` | daily use | `files.watcherExclude` and `search.exclude` (D33) |
