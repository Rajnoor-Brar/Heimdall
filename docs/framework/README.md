# Heimdall: the plan set (README, round 1, amended through round 2c)

This is the round-1 document of a two-round plan. Round 2 writes the plan files that AI agents follow
on a **fresh system**:
- to build `$HEP` as the one home of the software stack **and** of the framework and its
  environment;
- to create **work directories**: any number, independent of each other, each holding only configs,
  modules, projects and what they produce.

This page fixes what round 2 must not reopen:
- the decisions (§2);
- the target layout (§3);
- the file set (§4);
- how the agents coordinate (§5);
- the couplings to undo (§6);
- round 2's brief (§7).

The planning rounds change nothing on this install: no code, no config, no `~/HEP`. The plans are
executed on the **lab PC after a clean reinstall** (the fresh system; amended in round 2a), and later
on other machines.

Written 2026-10-08 against `rework` at `33b0ed9`. Amended the same day in round 2a (D2, D5, D13,
D15–D16): High-Energy becomes the lean work repo, and the fresh system is the reinstalled lab PC.
Round 2b (2026-10-10, against `9cb907a`, after the decks V102–V104) wrote the phase files and the
annexes. [01_Target.md](01_Target.md) details the target; **[03_Preflight.md](03_Preflight.md) is
where a fresh machine starts**, after [02_Agents.md](02_Agents.md) §1.

**Round 2c (2026-10-10), the user's layout:**
- the framework is **Heimdall**, at `~/Github/Heimdall`, and Heimdall **is `$HEP`**;
- the stack's recipes sit at its root;
- `env/` holds the HEP and Python environment;
- `framework/` holds what runs, and `src/` what is compiled;
- ignored: `stack/` (installs), `forge/` (builds in progress), `stash/` (downloads), `env/venv/`,
  `framework/Apps/` (ready apps);
- **High-Energy is left alone**, and **Top-Quark** (`~/Github/Top-Quark`) is the test work dir.

D26–D33 below supersede parts of D1–D25, as marked.

---

## 1. Where things stand

Today one checkout, `~/Github/High-Energy`, is both framework and work
([06 §1](../06_Internals.md#1-repository-layout)):

| Side | Paths |
|---|---|
| framework | `utils/`: the runner, the tool folders, the C++ kits and apps, `hep`, `hep_env.sh`, `stack.toml`; `docs/stack/` (building the stack); the manual `docs/01`–`07`; `tests/`; `Makefile` |
| work | `configs/`, `modules/`, `build/`, `output/`, `results/`, `datasets/` |
| neither | `aux/`, `literature/`, `cross_machine/`, `_text/`, `_vs/`, `archive/`, `reports/`, `.vscode/`, `generator_comparison.*` |

`~/HEP` holds the source-built stack (`src/ build/ install/ .venv/`). Its `setup.sh` is a 9-line
stub that sources the checkout's `utils/Env/hep_env.sh` through `HEKIT_ROOT`. Making a second,
independent workspace therefore means cloning the whole framework again. The checkout is also the
only way to the environment.

**Portability.** The runner is standard-library Python (plus `tomli_w`), so it runs on every Linux
target: Ubuntu, a cluster node, a container. Those differ only in how the stack and its system
packages arrive. Two parts of the framework are not plain Python:

- **The compiled apps:** App_Pythia, App_PythiaCheck, App_yd2rt and Paint. They are built per
  machine, against that machine's stack, by one `hep build`.
- **Five Linux-only spots, which block macOS:**
  - `runner/events.py:17,188` uses abstract sockets and `/proc/net/unix`, so `hep run` does not
    start on a Mac ([stack/mac §5](../stack/mac/README.md#5-known-limits));
  - Paint's `Style.hh:112` reads `/proc/self/exe`;
  - `utils/Env/hep:48` calls `nproc`;
  - `Makefile:120` uses GNU `sed -i`;
  - `hep_env.sh` sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and needs bash 5.

Fixing these is a framework step (P3), not a per-target workaround.

---

## 2. Decisions

The user's answers of 2026-10-08:
- the framework becomes its own repo with fresh history;
- the plans cover all four targets;
- a work dir is found by a marker file, searched upward from the working directory;
- the agents run through and stop at gates;
- `hep setup <directory>` makes a work dir.

And in round 2a:
- the framework is called **HEimdall**;
- **High-Energy itself becomes the first work dir**, lean (the framework removed), at
  `~/Github/High-Energy`, with all three projects;
- the fresh system is **the lab PC, reinstalled**, so the old install's state needs no care.

And in round 2c (the user's layout, 2026-10-10):
- the framework is **Heimdall**, at `~/Github/Heimdall`, and it is `$HEP` itself;
- `env/` for the Python and HEP environment, `framework/` for what runs, `src/` for what is compiled;
- `stack/`, `forge/`, `stash/` (and `env/venv/`, `framework/Apps/`) are ignored;
- work dirs keep `build/`;
- High-Energy is left alone for now;
- `~/Github/Top-Quark` is made fresh by Heimdall, with the generic starter, as a test.

Round 2 details these decisions. It does not reopen them.

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | **`$HEP` is the machine's home.** It holds the stack (`src/ build/ install/ .venv/ logs/ .stamps/`), the framework repo, the framework's compiled apps and `setup.sh` (`load_hep`). There is one per machine. A second prefix is allowed, and work dirs are not bound to one. *(Superseded by D26: Heimdall itself is `$HEP`, at `~/Github/Heimdall`; the stack's folders are D27's.)* |
| D2 | **The framework is a new git repo with fresh history**, at `$HEP/HEimdall/`, seeded from High-Energy at a pinned revision (tag `split/base`). The import commit names that revision. High-Energy keeps the history: the record's citations (`git show 3a5ec16:…`, `rework/v1-final`) stay valid there. *(Amended in 2a: High-Energy is no longer only an archive; see D15.)* *(Path superseded by D26: `~/Github/Heimdall`. High-Energy is left alone, D31.)* |
| D3 | **A work dir is marked by `hep.toml`** at its root. `hep` finds it by walking up from the working directory, as git does, and `$HEP_WORK` overrides the search. Outside a work dir, work commands refuse and point to `hep setup`. Framework commands work anywhere: `hep explain`, `hep status --stack`, building the framework, `hep setup`. |
| D4 | **Work dirs are independent.** Each has its own `configs/ modules/ datasets/ build/ output/ results/ reports/`, and may have its own git repo. No path or import crosses work dirs, and they share only `$HEP`. V94's cross-project imports stay valid within a work dir. |
| D5 | **The framework's apps are compiled once per `$HEP`** and shared: App_*, Paint, Herwig's `HerwigDefaults.rpo`. A work dir builds only its own module programs and Rivet plugins, against `$HEP/HEimdall/kit`. *(Amended in 2a: the flag probe, `flags.sh` with `stack.toml`, is shared; each build tree keeps its own `flags.mk`, so a work dir's build never writes into `$HEP`.)* *(Locations superseded by D27 and D29: the apps in `framework/Apps/`, the kits in `src/`.)* |
| D6 | **One environment entry.** `$HEP/setup.sh` sources `$HEP/HEimdall/env/hep_env.sh`, with no outside checkout. The `HEKIT_*` variables become `HEP_*`: `HEP_FW`, `HEP_WORK`, `HEP_OUTPUT`, `HEP_RESULTS`, `HEP_CONFIGS`. This is the rename K15 ([current_plan](../../bots/current_plan.md)), done here. *(Superseded by D28: one variable, `HEP`; `setup.sh` is tracked; `hep_env.sh` is in `env/`.)* |
| D7 | **`{repo}` splits in two:** `{fw}` (the framework's apps, Herwig's repository) and `{work}` (`build/Rivet`, the module programs). A leading `./` in a run TOML means the work root, which restates V13. *(`{fw}` is `{hep}`, D28.)* |
| D8 | **Provenance records two git states**, the framework's and the work dir's, and the `$HEP` prefix. The identity rules are unchanged. The shared apps' `exe_sha256` is the same in every work dir on one machine. |
| D9 | **The framework's tests run against a frozen fixture work dir** inside the framework repo (`tests/fixtures/work/`, which has its own `hep.toml`). They never touch a real work dir, and V52's guard stays. |
| D10 | **`docs/stack/` moves into the framework as `stack/`**: `build_stack.py`, `packages.toml`, `settings.toml`, `patches/`, `mac/`, and `container/` (the Dockerfile and an Apptainer definition). Its `setup.sh` points at `$HEP/HEimdall`. Bootstrap: clone `HEimdall` into `$HEP` first (that needs only git and python3), then build the stack from it. *(Superseded by D26: the recipes are at Heimdall's root, with `patches/` and `platforms/{mac,container}/`.)* |
| D11 | **One framework for every target.** Portability fixes are framework code (P3). The annexes `targets/*.md` hold only differences: system packages, the stack overlay, launching. |
| D12 | **Three agents:** an orchestrator, a background builder and an independent verifier, with a per-machine state in `$HEP/.setup/` and named gates (§5). |
| D13 | **What is not the framework stays in High-Energy**: `aux/`, `_text/`, `_vs/`, `archive/`, `.vscode/`, `generator_comparison.*` and `docs/Untitled-1.md` (tracked), and `literature/`, `cross_machine/`, `datasets/`, `reports/` (untracked). `output/`, `results/` and `build/` are made afresh. The work dir template may carry an optional `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` pointing at `$HEP/HEimdall/kit`. *(Amended in 2a, by D15.)* *(D31: High-Energy is not changed at all; the template's `.vscode/` points at `$HEP/src`.)* |
| D14 | **`hep setup <directory>`** creates an empty, initialised work dir: what the framework requires, and the key folders (§3.1). It is the one supported way to make a work dir, and it also makes D9's fixture work dir. |
| D15 | **High-Energy becomes the lean work repo**, and the first work dir (2a, the user's). On the fresh system the clone of High-Energy is first the *source* (P0–P1: HEimdall is seeded from it). Then, in P5, on a new branch `work` from `split/base`, its framework files are removed (01 §7's move map), `hep setup --adopt` adds what a work dir needs, and `{repo}` becomes `{work}` (`hep migrate`). It holds Demo, Lambda and Comparison, and stays at `~/Github/High-Energy`. Pushing `work` is a gate. *(Paused by D31, the user's: High-Energy is left alone for now; its steps are parked in 08's appendix.)* |
| D16 | **The fresh system is the lab PC, reinstalled** (2a, the user's). Before the wipe, the user pushes `rework` and keeps what git does not hold (01 §8). The lab PC's baselines are recorded *now*, in round 2b, into these files, so they survive the wipe. Other machines use the same plans later. |

| D26 | **Heimdall is `~/Github/Heimdall`, and it is `$HEP`** (2c, the user's). One root holds the stack's recipes (`build_stack.py`, `packages.toml`, `settings.toml`, `patches/`, `platforms/`), `env/`, `framework/`, `src/`, `docs/ bots/ tests/`, and, ignored, `stack/ forge/ stash/ env/venv/ framework/Apps/ .setup/`. A clone builds its stack into itself: `python3 build_stack.py`. |
| D27 | **Where each kind of file goes** (2c, the user's). `stash/`: downloaded archives and their unpacked sources, nowhere else. `forge/`: builds in progress (the stack's trees, the framework's make intermediates, test binaries, test scratch, build logs). `stack/`: the installs. `framework/Apps/`: the framework's compiled apps, ready to use. |
| D28 | **One variable, `HEP`.** `HEP_INSTALL = $HEP/stack`; `HEP_FW` is not used; `{hep}` replaces `{fw}`. `setup.sh` is tracked and finds its own folder; per-machine lines go to `stack/setup_extra.sh`. |
| D29 | **`src/` is today's `utils/` minus `Env/` and `hepkit.py`**, so the Makefile's conventions carry over (`src/App_X.cc` → `framework/Apps/App_X.exe`), and modules use `-I $HEP/src`. **`env/`** holds `hep_env.sh`, `flags.sh`, `stack.toml`, `stack.py` and the venv `env/venv/` (the user, 2026-10-10). The venv's `heimdall.pth` is one line, `$HEP/framework`. |
| D30 | **Work dirs keep `build/`**, for their outputs and their make intermediates (2c, the user's). |
| D31 | **High-Energy is left alone for now** (2c, the user's). It is P0–P1's source and the fixture's origin only; its lean conversion (D15) is parked in 08's appendix. |
| D32 | **Top-Quark, `~/Github/Top-Quark`, is made fresh** by `hep setup --project Starter --git` with the generic starter, as P5's test work dir (2c, the user's). |
| D33 | **A repo that holds its own stack:** `git clean -x` is never run in Heimdall (it would delete `stack/`); editors exclude `stack/ forge/ stash/` (`files.watcherExclude`). |

**Answered in round 2a:** the name (HEimdall then, **Heimdall** since 2c) and the first work dir
(High-Energy then; **Top-Quark** since 2c, D32).

## 3. The target

```
~/Github/Heimdall/                  = $HEP: the framework and the machine's home (D26)
  README.md CLAUDE.md .gitignore Makefile pytest.ini setup.sh (load_hep)
  build_stack.py packages.toml settings.toml   patches/   platforms/{mac,container}/
  env/                              hep_env.sh flags.sh stack.toml stack.py;  venv/ (ignored)
  framework/                        bin/ runner/ tools/ schema/ templates/work/ work.mk hepkit.py;  Apps/ (ignored)
  src/                              the kits (*.hh), App_*.cc, Apps/Paint/
  docs/  bots/  tests/
  stack/  forge/  stash/  .setup/   (ignored) installs; builds in progress; downloads; the agents' state

~/Github/Top-Quark/                 a work dir, made by `hep setup` (D32); others anywhere
  hep.toml Makefile .gitignore README.md CLAUDE.md .vscode/
  configs/ modules/ datasets/ results/ output/ reports/ build/
```

[01_Target.md](01_Target.md) §2–4 give every folder and file.

### 3.1 `hep setup <directory>`

**What it makes**, from `framework/templates/work/` (a new file is a template edit, never a code change):
- the key folders `configs/ datasets/ modules/ results/ output/ reports/ build/`;
- `hep.toml`, which holds the work dir's name and the framework revision it was made with
  (`[framework] expects`);
- the one-line `Makefile`;
- a `.gitignore` for `build/`, `output/`, `results/` and the large files in `datasets/` and
  `reports/`;
- `README.md` (what each folder is for);
- `CLAUDE.md` (the work dir's agent rules);
- `.vscode/settings.json`, excluding `build/ output/ results/` from watching (D33).

**Options:**
- `--project <P>` also makes `configs/<P>/` and `modules/<P>/`, with a commented starter run TOML
  and base card that `hep check` accepts;
- `--git` runs `git init` and makes the first commit;
- `--adopt` makes a work dir of an existing checkout that has no marker yet (High-Energy, when its
  parked conversion is asked for). It adds only what is missing and reports the files it kept.

**Safety:**
- A missing or empty directory is set up.
- An existing work dir is completed, never overwritten: the command adds only what is missing and
  lists it.
- A non-empty directory that is not a work dir is refused, with a hint, unless `--adopt` is given.
- Nothing is written outside `<directory>`.

**Verification rows** (round 2 writes them into P3's step):

| Row | Expected |
|---|---|
| a fresh directory | its tree matches the template (counts of files and folders) |
| a second `hep setup` on it | 0 files added |
| a non-empty foreign directory | refused, exit 2 |
| `--project Toy`, then `hep check Toy/<starter>` | passes |
| `hep build` in the new work dir | clean, 0 targets |
| `hep` from a subfolder of it | resolves this work dir |

---

## 4. The file set round 2 writes

| File | Phase | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | — | this page (round 1, amended through 2c) |
| `01_Target.md` | — | both trees in full; **the seam**: the variables, the two roots, the marker search, placeholders, includes, hepkit, provenance, tests; **the move map** (every `git ls-files` path → its new home, or "stays in High-Energy"); the D-rows extended |
| `02_Agents.md` | — | the coordination scheme of §5 in full, with the orchestrator's start prompt |
| `03_Preflight.md` | P0 | survey the machine (OS, arch, cores, RAM, disk, sudo, network, docker/apptainer, python ≥ 3.11); pick the annex; clone High-Energy (pushed before the reinstall, or from a `git bundle`), tag `split/base`; create `~/Github/Heimdall/.setup/` and bring back what was kept before the wipe |
| `04_Seed.md` | P1 | create `~/Github/Heimdall` from the move map: mechanical moves only, `setup.sh`, `.gitignore`, the fixture work dir, the import commit |
| `05_Stack.md` | P2 | `build_stack.py`, from Heimdall's root, into `stack/ forge/ stash/` and `env/venv/`, with the annex's overlay, **in the background** (hours) while P3 proceeds; then versions, the FastJet patch, `import ROOT`/`pythia8`/`yoda`, the 21 PDF sets |
| `06_Seam.md` | P3 | the code changes:<br>• paths: two roots, the marker search<br>• placeholders<br>• the Makefile split<br>• the environment<br>• `hep`'s resolution<br>• **`hep setup <dir>` as its own step** (template, command, tests)<br>• the `HEP_*` rename<br>• provenance<br>• hepkit importable<br>• tests on the fixture work dir<br>• `docs.py`/`test_docs`<br>• the macOS spots of §1 |
| `07_Framework.md` | P4 | `hep build` (the apps); `make test`, then the slow suite, with pass counts against the lab PC's baseline; `make docs`; the manual rewritten for the split (01 layout, 02 §1 and §12, 05 §2, 06 §1, §2, §14 and §15) |
| `08_Workdirs.md` | P5 | Top-Quark made fresh (`hep setup ~/Github/Top-Quark --project Starter --git`), built, checked and run; a throwaway second work dir and the checks that the two are independent; appendix: High-Energy's lean conversion, parked |
| `09_Verify.md` | P6 | the physics gates (`tests/reference`); one small Demo point, run in a scratch work dir from High-Energy's files, against the lab PC's numbers (σ, counts, YODA sums, within stated tolerances); handover: the agent rules, the final report, publishing Heimdall (a gate) |
| `targets/ubuntu.md`, `cluster.md`, `container.md`, `macos.md` | annexes | **differences only**, under four headings (below) |

The annexes cover:
- **where the system packages come from:** apt; none, with Apptainer or environment modules; the
  image; the Brewfile;
- **the overlay TOML;**
- **launching;**
- **known limits:**
  - on a cluster: FIFOs on a shared filesystem, and no sudo;
  - in a container: abstract sockets are per network namespace;
  - on macOS: bash 5, and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

**Step format.** Each phase has 2–3 substantial steps. Each step gives:
- its id and goal;
- **preconditions:** the earlier steps done, plus probe commands;
- **tasks:** exact commands, or edits by file:line;
- the **gates** it touches;
- **verification rows:** a command and the number or text it must give;
- **on failure:** what to collect, and when to stop.

**Logs are per machine,** in `$HEP/.setup/log.md`, not in the plan files. The same plans serve the
new machine, a cluster and, later, the lab PC after its OS upgrade. Their logs must not collide in
git.

## 5. How the agents coordinate

### Roles

| Role | Does |
|---|---|
| **Orchestrator** (the main session) | reads this page, then 01, then 02, then the state; picks the next step; works inline by default. It is the only one that writes `$HEP/.setup/state.toml`, and the only one that talks to the user |
| **Builder** (background) | the long builds only: the stack (P2) and the slow suite. It runs them with a monitor and reports on exit |
| **Verifier** (a fresh context, read-only) | re-runs a phase's verification rows and the tests once the orchestrator calls the phase done, and reports the numbers. A phase is done only when its verifier agrees |

### State

`state.toml` holds, for each step:
- its status: `todo`, `running`, `done`, `failed` or `blocked`;
- its verification numbers, and when they were taken.

It also holds this machine's choices (the annex, cores, packages, the pinned revision) and the
approvals given at gates.

The stack's stamps (`$HEP/stack/.stamps/`) stay authoritative for packages. **Resuming** means: read the
state, then re-run the current step's preconditions.

### Gates

At each of these the orchestrator stops and asks the user:
- sudo or apt;
- downloads: the list and its size, approved once per phase (the stack's tarballs, plus about 4 GB
  of Geant4 data);
- joining the docker group (the user's own action);
- any deletion outside `$HEP/{stash,forge}` (D27: they may be emptied);
- any write to the High-Energy clone other than P0's tag `split/base` (D31: it is left alone);
- a change to the content of `configs/` or `modules/` (P5's diffs, shown first);
- pushing or publishing a repo or an image;
- a verification row that fails twice;
- anything the plan files do not decide.

### Concurrency and reports

**Concurrency:**
- one stack build at a time;
- one pytest session at a time;
- P3's edits may proceed while P2 builds;
- tests that need the stack wait for P2.

**Reports:** a short one at every gate and at every phase's end, saying what is done, its numbers,
and what is next.

### Rules carried over

From [BOT.md](../../bots/BOT.md) and the working agreements:
- stage commits by path;
- tests write only their scratch;
- `encoding="utf-8"` on every text read and write;
- read a tool's ledger rows ([07 §3](../07_Record.md#3-the-knowledge-ledger)) before touching it;
- the user's configs are theirs.

## 6. The couplings to undo

This table is round 1's, with round 1's target paths; it is kept as the record. Every row was checked by grep on 2026-10-08. Round 2a re-verified the rows and extended them into
[01 §6](01_Target.md#6-every-coupling-classified) (C1–C78), which has the current line numbers.

| # | Where | Today | Becomes |
|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | `utils/Env/runner/paths.py:23-70` | one root, found by the markers `configs, modules, utils/Env` or by `HEKIT_ROOT`; `results_root`, `output_root`, `configs_root` and `build_root` all hang from it | `fw_root()` (the runner's own location, or `HEP_FW`) and `work_root()` (the marker search, or `HEP_WORK`) |
| I2 | `paths.py:77-86`, `ROOTS` | `executable` → `build/<P>`, `data` → `datasets/` | the work root |
| I3 | framework files read through `repo_root()`: `labels.py:22`, `quantities.py:31,73,272`, `schema.py:33`, `plot.py:127,168,397,486,1117`, `docs.py:81,159`, `cli.py:678`, `config.py:847`, `tools.py:326` | the repo | the framework root |
| I4 | the apps through `build_root()`: `plot.py:292,328` (App_yd2rt), `plot.py:1083,1236` (Paint) | `build/` | the framework's build |
| I5 | Rivet through `build_root()`: `hepfiles.py:73`, `yoda/backend.py:313`, `mpl/backend.py:102` | `build/Rivet` | the work build |
| I6 | `{repo}` in the tool folders | `pythia/tool.toml:4,44`, `yd2rt:5`, `plotmerge:12`, `herwig:33,48` (apps, Herwig's repository); `rivet:15,26,29,42`, `merge:13` (`build/Rivet`) | `{fw}` for the first group, `{work}` for the second; the contexts in `execute.py:294` and `tools.py:215,264,671,928,994,1030,1046,1099,1324` follow, and so does `schema/run.toml:370` (`[prelim.commands]`) |
| I7 | `record.py:234-241` | `git_state()` of one repo | two states (D8) |
| I8 | `Makefile` | one file: `-I utils`; the rules for apps, modules, Rivet, `tests/cxx`, Herwig, flags, schema and docs | `HEimdall/Makefile` and `make/work.mk` |
| I9 | `utils/Env/hep` | root from `HEKIT_ROOT` or `../..`; `make -C $root`; `nproc` | framework and work resolution; `hep setup` (D14); a portable core count |
| I10 | `utils/Env/hep_env.sh:10-17,133-136,177` | `HEKIT_ROOT` default; `utils/Env` on `PATH`; `hep_cd` | `$HEP/HEimdall/bin`; `hep_cd` within the current work dir |
| I11 | `~/HEP/setup.sh`; `docs/stack/build_stack.py:52-55,177,443`; `settings.toml`'s `hekit_root`; `packages.toml`'s FastJet patch path; the `Dockerfile` (`COPY` paths, `HEKIT_ROOT=/work`); `mac/launch.sh` | the stack points at a checkout | all inside the framework repo; `setup.sh` written for `$HEP/HEimdall` |
| I12 | `tests/conftest.py` (`REPO`, `sys.path`, `SCRATCH`, `FIXTURES`, the guard's `OURS`/`THEIRS`), `pytest.ini`, `tests/support.py`, `tests/runner/helpers.py`, `test_paths.py` | one repo | the fixture work dir; scratch under the framework's build |

## 7. Round 2's brief

Round 2 runs only on the user's order. It may write `docs/framework/` and `bots/current_plan.md`,
and nothing else: no code, configs or `~/HEP`.

**2a: `01_Target.md` and `02_Agents.md`.**
- Re-verify §6 by grep and extend it to a full classification of every `repo_root()`,
  `build_root()` and `{repo}` use.
- Build the move map from `git ls-files`, so that every tracked path is assigned.
- Ask the two open questions: the framework's name, and the first work dir (answered: HEimdall;
  High-Energy itself, D15).
- **Stop for the user's review.**

**2b: the phase files `03`–`09` and the four annexes** (done 2026-10-10).
- Every row of §6 lands in a named step's tasks.
- `hep setup` gets its own P3 step (template, command, tests), and P5 uses it for every work dir.
- Every step has at least one verification row with a number.
- Record the lab PC's baselines read-only, from what is already recorded, with no rebuild and no
  long test:
  - `hep status --stack`;
  - the latest pass counts;
  - `build/flags.mk`'s `FOUND`;
  - the number of PDF sets;
  - one small reference point's σ, counts and YODA sums.

**2c: the user's layout** (done 2026-10-10).
- Heimdall at `~/Github/Heimdall`, which is `$HEP`; `env/`, `framework/`, `src/`; `stack/ forge/
  stash/` ignored; Top-Quark the test work dir; High-Energy left alone (D26–D33).
- 01 rewritten for it, with C79–C80 added and the move map re-tested by P1's own script; 02–09 and
  the annexes re-pointed; 08 rewritten around Top-Quark, with High-Energy's conversion parked in its
  appendix.
