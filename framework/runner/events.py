"""The event stream: what a run says while it runs, and who hears it (rank 1).

docs/06_Internals.md §10, audit 1 B3 (V72). The executor, the stages and the CLI emit **events** onto
one `Bus`; each is a dict with the stream's version `v`, the point and tool it is about (`""` for the run),
the time `t`, and its kind `k`:

    run    state = started (points, title, header) | finished (verdict)
    point  state = started (index, stage) | done | stopped | failed (cause, msg, res) | skipped
    tool   state = started                     exit   code, seconds, error
    phase, progress, xsec, log                  a tool's own status (utils/Status.hh, or its filters)
    line   a tool's latest output line (at most twice a second per tool)
    note   a line for the point's block        say    a line of the run's

Runtime state stays off disk (the user, 2026-10-03). Who hears the bus:
* the view, always (watch.py);
* the **Hub**, while the process lives: an abstract Unix socket `@hep-watch-<pid>` (no file, no path
  limit). `hep watch` finds it in /proc/net/unix, gets a greeting, the current run's events so far
  (a tool's progress only as its latest), then every event live. A sweep of runs is one process, so
  the stream follows from run to run by itself;
* the **Journal**, only with `--journal`: the same events in output/…/status.jsonl, one file per run,
  for replay (`hep watch --file`) and tests.

A subscriber is called on the emitting thread and must not block; the Hub queues for each client and
drops a client that stops reading. In a sweep of runs, each run emits through a `RunBus`, which adds
`run` (its configuration's key) to every event, since a pipelined sweep's runs overlap (V75).
