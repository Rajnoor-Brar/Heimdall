"""Running a point: [prelim], the tool groups, supervision, the checks (rank 3).

docs/06_Internals.md §11. A FIFO chain fails in two ways a single process does not,
and both are handled here by construction:

* **Deadlock at open (L8).** A FIFO blocks until both ends are open. If the writer dies before
  opening, the reader waits for ever and gets no SIGPIPE. So each tool runs in its own process
  group. The first nonzero exit is the cause, and after a grace period the rest of the group gets
  SIGTERM, then SIGKILL. A tool silent for `stall_after` seconds (no output, status or heartbeat)
  counts as failed.
* **A partial result that looks complete.** If the generator dies mid-stream, Rivet sees end of file
  and exits 0. So a consumer's event count is checked against the producer's sidecar, and a product
  keeps its `.partial` name until every check has passed. `.complete` is written last.

Attribution: the cause is the first process to exit nonzero before the runner sent any signal. A
SIGPIPE death is a consequence (its reader went away), never the cause: the reader is blamed, even
when both exits are seen in the same poll (found by P1's failure injection).

**Points at once** (`parallelism = K`, V36): `run_points` runs up to K points on threads of their
own, each through the same `run_point`. Nothing of a point is shared with another (its folder holds
its FIFOs, logs and products), except the event bus (locked) and a prepare cache entry, which one
point at a time may fill (`_prepare_lock`: a lock in this process and flock across processes).

**What is said** goes onto the run's event bus (events.py, V72): a point's and a tool's start and end,
and every status message. A tool's output is read from a pipe (status.Reader); only a failed tool's last
lines reach logs/<tag>.log, unless `logs` (--logs) keeps every tool's whole log.
