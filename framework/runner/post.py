"""The pre and post stages: tools run once, before every point or after them (rank 4).

docs/06_Internals.md §7, docs/04_Config_Reference.md §5.4 (V15). `[run.cfgs.<cfg>].post` has the form of
`tools`. It is planned as one more point, named "post", in the configuration's directory:

* it takes no quantities;
* an `input` naming a product of the points (`input = "jets.yoda"`) reads that product of every
  point, spliced into argv by `{inputs}`;
* `{points}` is the points manifest, points.json: every point's values, tags and product paths;
* its identity hashes its own tools and every point's identity, so it reruns when any point changes,
  and is skipped otherwise, like a point.

It runs only when every point of the configuration is complete: a merge or a fit over a subset
would look like the whole.

`combine = ["replica"]` (V35) plans one more stage per group of points that differ only in the
combined quantities: rivet-merge -e of the group's YODA product into <cfg>/<group>/, a file of the
same name. Each runs once its own points are complete, and the plot stage draws the groups.
