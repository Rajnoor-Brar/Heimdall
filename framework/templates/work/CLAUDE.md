# {{name}} — a Heimdall work dir

- `configs/` and `modules/` are the user's: change them only when asked, and show the diff.
- `results/`, `records/`, `.cache/` and `build/` are made by `heimdall run` and `heimdall build`. Never write into
  `results/` from a test or a script: use a scratch work dir (`heimdall setup <scratch>`).
- The manual is `$HEIMDALL/docs/README.md` (Heimdall's, `heimdall where --heimdall`). Read the relevant page before
  writing an errand file; `heimdall explain <key>` and `heimdall check` say what a key means and whether a file is valid.
- Paths in configs: `{work}` is this folder, `{heimdall}` is Heimdall.
- Commit by path (`git add <files>`), never `git commit -a`.
