"""Test setup shared by every suite.

* The runner package is importable as `runner` (utils/Env on sys.path), and tests/ is on sys.path for
  `support` (the shared helpers).
* Tests read and write only their own places, whatever the shell has set: HEKIT_RESULTS, HEKIT_OUTPUT
  and HEKIT_REPORTS point into output/tests/, and HEKIT_CONFIGS to tests/fixtures/configs (frozen
  copies), so a test never reads the user's configs/ and fails only when the code changed.
* The basetemp is output/tests/pytest from the repository, wherever pytest is started.
* The session guard: tests/fixtures and tests/reference must come out byte for byte as they went in
  (a failure). results/, configs/ and modules/ are the user's, who may edit them while tests run, so a
  change there is reported at the end (a test escaping HEKIT_* would show up there), not failed.
